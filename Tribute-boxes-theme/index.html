Hello Camper!

For now, the test suite only works in Chrome! Please read the README below in the JS Editor before beginning. Feel free to delete this message once you have read it. Good luck and Happy Coding!

#Content
1. My tribute page should have an element with corresponding id="main", which contains all other elements.
2. I should see an element with corresponding id="title", which contains a string (i.e. text) that describes the subject of the tribute page (e.g. "Dr. Norman Borlaug").
3. I should see a <div> element with corresponding id="img-div".
4. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an <img> element with a corresponding id="image".
5. Within the "img-div" element, I should see an element with a corresponding id="img-caption" that contains textual content describing the image shown in "img-div". 
6. I should see an element with a corresponding id="tribute-info", which contains textual content describing the subject of the tribute page. 
7. I should see an <a> element with a corresponding id="tribute-link", which links to an outside site that contains additional information about the subject of the tribute page. HINT: You must give your element an attribute of target and set it to "_blank" in order for your link to open in a new tab (i.e. target="_blank"). 
#Layout
1. The <img> element should responsively resize, relative to the width of its parent element, without exceeding its original size. 
2. The <img> element should be centered within its parent element.
